# MNIST_KNN
This module is limited to making use of the classifier KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn to apply it to the recognition of handwritten digits in the MNIST file, with a hit rate higher than 95% and extraordinary simplicity, especially compared to the complexity of classifiers based on neural networks. It also shows full sensitivity.
